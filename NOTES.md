v1.3.7

## Difference
- The original system had 10 values (0 - 10, from #FFF to #000)
- The original system had a total of 11 values (0-10), 

- where 0 = #000000
- where 10 = #ffffff

so, incrementing by approx 9.09%, this is referred to as "10bit"
The original color system was 10bit (#000 to #FFF)
